✨ **DSAMate Logo - xshriya**

I created this logo to capture the idea of learning DSA in a simple, connected, and approachable way.
The node and connection symbol represents problem-solving and logical flow.
The style of “DSA” + “Mate” keeps a balance between technical and friendly.
I used blue tones because they feel reliable and calm, while still giving a smart and modern look.
There are both light and dark versions.
